## Setup
Written in [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

I also used [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the 'socket' package.

**Installing pip for:**
[Windows](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows) or [Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux/)

**Installing socket with pip**
```
pip install socket
```
### Running the script
Open terminal the folder when the script is and run
```
python hw1.py IP [IP...]
```
